# Training Projects

I'm not that good at writing either at GitHub. I'm a beginner web-developer and as a developer, I want to also develop myself in this field and reach great things in it.
This is the repository where my training projects will be placed in order to review myself in the future. Also, I may use this as a small view of my reached goals.
